- Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance
- AMIs are region specific, if you need to use an AMI in another region you can copy an AMI into the destination region via Copy AMI
- You can create an AMI from existing EC2 instance that is either running or stopped
- Community AMI are free AMIs maintained by the Community
- AWS Marketplace free or paid subcription AMIs maintained by vendors
- AMIs have an AMI ID. The same AMI eg. (Amazon Linux 2) will vary in both AMI ID and options eg. Architecture options in different regions

  + A template for the roote volume for the instance (EBS Snapshot or Instance Store template), an operating system, an application server and applications
  + Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances
  + A block device mapping that specifics the volume to attch to the instance when it's launch
