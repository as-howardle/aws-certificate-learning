What is DNS?
- Domain Name System which translates the human friendly hostnames into the machine IP Addresses
- DNS is the backbone of the Internet
- DNS uses hierarchical naming structure

DNS Terminologies
- Domain Registrar: Amazon Route53, GoDaddy,...
- DNS Records: A, AAAA, CNAME, NS, ...
- Zone File: contains DNS Records
- Name Server: resolves DNS queries (Authoritative or Non-Authoritative)
- Top Level Domain (TLD): .com, .us, .in, ....
- Second Level Domain (SLD): amazon.com, google.com, ...

Amazon Route 53
- A highly available, scalable, fully managed and Authoritative DNS
  - Authoritative = the customer (you ) can update the DNS Records
- Route 53 is also a Domain Registrar 
- Ability to check the health of your resources
- The only AWS service which provides 100% availability SLA
- Why Route 53? 53 is a reference to the traditional DNS port

Records
- How you want to route traffice for a domain
- Each record contains:
  - Domain/subdomain Name - eg. example.com
  - Record Type - eg. A or AAAA,...
  - Value - eg. 12.34.56.78
  - Routing Policy - how Route 53 responds to queries
  - TTL - amount of time the record cached at DNS queries
- Route 53 supports the following DNS record types:
  - (must know) A/AAAA/CNAME/NS
  - (advanced) CAA/DS/MX/NAPTR/PTR/SOA/TXT/SPF/SRV

Record Types
- A - maps a hostname to IPv4
- AAAA - maps a hostname to IPv6
- CNAME - maps a hostname to another hostname
  - The target is a domain name which must have an A or AAAA record 
  - Can't create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace (Zone Apex)
  - Example: you can't create for example.com, but you can create for www.example.com
- NS - Name Servers for the Hosted Zone
 - Control how traffic is routed for a domain

Hosted zones
- A container for records that define how to route traffic to a domain and its subdomains
- Public Hosted Zones - contains records that specify how to route traffice on the Internet (public domain names)
- Private Hosted Zones - containes records that specify how you route traffic within one or more VPCs (private domain names)
- You pay $0.5 per month per hosted zone

Records TTL
- High TTL:
  - Less traffic on Route 53
  - Possibly outdated records
- Low TTL:
  - More traffic on Route 53
  - Records are outdated for less time
  - Easy to change records
- Except for Alias records, TTL is mandatory for each DNS record

CNAME vs Alias
- AWS Resources (Load Balancer, CloudFront) expose an AWS hostname:
- CNAME:
  - Points a hostname to any other hostname
  - ONLY FOR NON ROOT DOMAIN
- Alias:
  - Points a hostname to an AWS resources
  - Works for ROOT DOMAIN and NON ROOT DOMAIN
  - Free of charge
  - Native health check
