Amazon RDS Overview
- RDS stands for Relational Database Service
- It's a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language
- It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS 
 * Postgres
 * MySQL
 * MariaDB
 * Oracle
 * Microsoft SQL Server
 * Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)

Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2
- RDS is a managed service:
  - Automated provisioning, OS patching
  - Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)
  - Monitoring dashboards
  - Read replicas for improved read performance
  - Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
  - Maintenance windows for upgrades
  - Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
  - Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
- BUT you can't SSH into your instances

RDS - Storage Auto Scaling
- Helps you increase storage on your RDS DB instances
- When RDS detects you are running out of free database storage, it scales automatically
- Avoid manuallly scaling your database storage
- You have to set Maximum Storage Threshhold (maximum limit for DB storage)
- Automatically modify storage if:
  - Free storage is less than 10% of allocated storage
  - Low-storage lasts at least 5 minutes
  - 6 hours have passed since last modification
- Useful for applications with unpredictable workloads
- Supports all RDS database engines

RDS Read Replicas for read scalability
- Up to 15 Read Replicas
- Within AZ, cross AZ or Cross Region
- Replication is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent
- Replicas can be promoted to their own DB
- Applications must update the connection string to leverage read replicas

RDS Read Replicas - Use cases
- You have a production database that is taking on normal load
- You want to run a reporting application to run some analytics
- You create a Read Replica to run the new workload there
- The production application is unaffected
- Read replicas are used for SELECT (=read) only kind of statements (not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

RDS Read Replicas - Network cost
- In AWS there's a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another
- For RDS Read Replicas within the same region, you don't pay that fee

RDS Multi AZ (Diaster Recovery)
- SYNC replication
- One DNS name - automatic app failover to standby
- Increase availability
- Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance of storage failure
- No manual intervention in apps
- Not used for scaling
- Note: The Read Replicas be setup as Multi AZ for Diaster Recovery (DR)

RDS - From Single AZ to Multi AZ
- Zero downtime operation (no need to stop the DB)
- Just click on "modify" for the database
- The following happens internally:
  - A snapshot is taken
  - A new DB is restored from the snapshot in a new AZ
  - Synchronization is established between the two databases

RDS Custom
- Managed Oracle and Microsoft SQl Server Databases with OS and database customization
- RDS: Automates setup, operation, and scaling of database in AWS
- Custom: access to the underlying database and OS so you can:
  - Configure settings
  - Install patches
  - Enable native features
  - Access the underlying EC2 instance using SSH or SSM Session Manager
- De-active Automation Mode to perform your customization, better to take a DB snapshot before
- RDS vs RDS Custom:
  - RDS: entire database and the OS to be managed by AWS
  - RDS Custom: full admin access to the underlying OS and the database

Amazon Aurora
- Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced)
- Postgres and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB (that means your drivers will work as if Aurora
was a Postgres or MySQL database)
- Aurora is "AWS cloud optimized" and claims 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS,
over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS
- Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 128TB.
- Aurora can have up to 15 replicas and the replication process is faster than MySQL (sub 10ms replica lag)
- Failover in Aurora is instantaneous. It's HA (High Availability) native
- Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) - but is more efficient

Aurora High Availability and Read Scaling
- 6 copies of your data across 3 AZ
  - 4 copies out of 6 needed for writes
  - 3 copies out of 6 need for reads
  - Self healing with peer-to-peer replication
  - Storage is striped across 100s of volumes
- Automated failover for master in less than 30 seconds
- One Aurora Instance takes writes (master)
- Master + up to 15 Aurora Read Replicas serve reads
- Support for Cross Region Replication

Feature of Aurora
- Automatic fail-over
- Backup and Recovery
- Isolation and security
- Industry compliance
- Push-button scaling
- Automated Patching with Zero downtime
- Advanced Monitoring
- Routine Maintenance
- Backtrack: restore data at any point of time without using backups

Aurora Serverless
- Automated database instantiation and auto-scaling based on actual usage
- Good for infrequent, intermittent or unpredictable workloads
- No capacity planning needed
- Pay per second, can be more cost-effective

Global Aurora
- Aurora Cross Region Read Replicas:
  - Usefull for disaster Recovery
  - Simple to put in place
- Aurora Global Database (recommended):
  - 1 primary region (read/write)
  - Up to 5 secondary (read-only) regions, replication lag is less than 1 second
  - Up to 16 Read Replicas per secondary region
  - Helps for decreasing latency
  - Promoting another region (for disaster recovery) has an RTO of < 1 minute
  - Typical cross-region replication take less than 1 second

Aurora Machine Learning
- Enables you to add ML-based predictions to your applications via SQL 
- Simple, optimized, and secure integration between Aurora and AWS ML services
- Suported services
  - Amazon SageMaker (use with any ML model)
  - Amazon Comprehend (for sentiment analysis)
- You don't need to have ML experience
- Use cases: fraud detection, ads targeting, sentiment analysis, product recommendatations

RDS backups
- Automated backups:
  - Daily full backup of the database (during the backup window)
  - Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes
  - => ability to restore to any point in time (from oldest backup to 5 minutes ago)
  - 1 to 35 days of retention, set 0 to disable automated backups
- Manual DB snapshots
  - Manually triggered by the user
  - Retention of backup for as long as you want
- Trick: in a stopped RDS database, you will still pay for storage. If you plan on stopping it for
long time, you should snapshot it and restore instead

Aurora backups
- Automated backups
  - 1 to 35 days (cannot be disabled)
  - point-in-time recovery in that timeframe
- Manual DB snapshots
  - Manually triggerd by the user
  - Retention of backup for as long as you want

RDS & Aurora restore options
- Restoring a RDS/Aurora backup or a snopshot creates a new database
- Restoring MySQL RDS database from S3
  - Create a backup of your on-premises database
  - Store it on Amazon S3 (object storage)
  - Restore the backup file onto a new RDS instance running MySQL
- Restoring MySQL Aurora cluster from S3
  - Create a backup of your on-premises database using Percona XtraBackup
  - Store the backup file on Amazon S3
  - Restore the backup file onto a new Aurora cluster running MySQL

Aurora Database Cloning
- Create a new Aurora DB Cluster from an existing one
- Faster than snapshot and restore
- Use copy-on-write protocol
  - Initially, the new DB cluster uses the same data volume as the original DB cluster (fast and
  efficient - no copying is needed)
  - When updates are made to the new DB cluster data, then additional storage is allocated and data
  is copied to be separated
- Very fast and cost effective
- Useful to create a staging database from a production database without impacting the production database

RDS and Aurora Security
- At-rest encryption:
  - Database master & replicas encryption using AWS KMS - must be defined as launch time
  - If the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted
  - To encrypt an un-encrypted database, go through a DB snapshot & restore as encrypted
- In-flight encryption: TLS-ready by default, use the AWS TLS root certificates client-side
- IAM Authentication: IAM roles to connect to your database (instead of username/password)
- Security groups: Control Network access to your RDS/Aurora DB
- No SSH Available except on RDS custom
- Audit Logs can be enabled and sent to CloudWatch Logs for longer retention

Amazon RDS Proxy
- Fully managed database proxy for RDS
- Allows apps to pool and share DB connections established with the database
- Improving database efficiency by reducing the stress on database resources (eg. CPU, RAM) and minimize open connections (and timeouts)
- Serverless, autoscaling, high available (multi - AZ)
- Reduced RDS & Aurora failover time by up 66%
- Supports RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MS SQL Server) and Aurora (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- No code changes required for most apps
- Enforce IAM Authentication for DB, and securely store credentials in AWS Secrets Manager
- RDS Proxy is nerver publicly acccessible (must be accessed from VPC)

Amazon ElastiCache Overview
- The same way RDS is to get managed Relational Databases
- ElastiCache is to get managed Redis or Memcached
- Caches are in-memory databases with really high performance, low latency
- Helps reduce load off of databases for read intensive workloads
- Help make your application stateless
- AWS takes care of OS maintenance / patching, optimizations, setup, configuration, monitoring, failure recovery and backups
- Using ElastiCache involves heavy application code changes

ElastiCache Solution Architecture - DB Cache
- Applications queries ElastiCache, if not available, get from RDS and store in ElastiCache
- Helps relieve load in RDS
- Cache must have an invalidation strategy to make sure only the most current data is used in there

ElastiCache Solution Architecture - User Session Store
- User logs into any of the application
- The application writes the session data into ElastiCache
- The user hits another instance of our application
- The instance retrieves the data and the user is already logged in

ElastiCache - Cache security
- ElastiCache supports IAM Authentication for Redis
- IAM Policies on ElastiCache are only used for AWS API-level security
- Redis AUTH
  - You can set a "password/token" when you create a Redis cluster
  - This is an extra level of security for your cache (on top of security groups)
  - Support SSL in flight encryption
- Memcached
  - Supports SASL-based authentication (advanced)

Patterns for ElastiCache
- Lazy Loading: all the read data is cached, data can become stale in cache
- Write through: adds or update data in cache when written to a DB (no stale data)
- Session storage: store temporary session data in a cache (using TTL features)

ElastiCache - Redis Use Case
- Gaming Leaderboards are computationally complex
- Redis Sorted sets guarantee both uniqueness and element ordering
- Each time a new element added, it's ranked in real time, then added in correct order
