What's an EBS Volume
* An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive that you can attach to your instance while they run
* It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
* They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level)
* They are bound to a specific availability zone
* Analogy: Think of them as a "network USB stick"
* Free tier: 30GB of free EBS storage of type General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic per month

EBS Volume
* It's a network drive (not a physical drive)
  * It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
  * It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
* It's locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
  * An EBS volume in us-east-1a cannot be attached to us-east-1b
  * To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
* Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs. and IOPS)
  * You get billed for all the provisioned capacity
  * You can increase the capacity of the drive over time

EBS - Delete on Termination attribute
* Controls the EBS behaviour when an EC2 instance terminates
  * By default, the root EBS volume is deleted (attribute enabled)
  * By default, any other attached EBS volume is not deleted (attribute disabled)
* This can be controlled by the AWS console / AWS CLI
* Use case: preserve root volume when instance is terminated

EBS Snapshots
* Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
* Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
* Can copy snapshot across AZ or Region

EBS Snapshots Features
* EBS Snapshot Archive
  * Move a Snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper
  * Takes within 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive
* Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots
  * Setup rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
  * Specify retention (from 1 day to 1 year)
* Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
  * Force full initialization of snapshot to have no latency on the first rule.
