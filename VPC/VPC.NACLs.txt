- Network Access Control List is commonly known as NACL
- VPCs are automatically given a default NACL which allows all outbound and inbound traffic
- Each subnet within a VPC must be associated with a NACL
- Subnets can only be associated with 1 NACL at time. Associating a subnet with a new NACL will remove
the previous association
- If a NACL is not explicitly associated with a subnet, the subnet will automatically be associated
with the default NACL
- NACL has inbound and outbound rules (just like Security Groups)
- Rule can either allow or deny traffic. (unlike Security Groups which can only allow)
- NACLS are STATELESS (any change applied to an inbound rule isn't automatically applied to an outbound rule)
- When you create a NACLs it will deny all traffic by default
- NACLs contain a numbered list of rules that gets evaluated in order from lowest to highest
- If you need to block a single IP address you could do it via NACLs (Security Groups cannot deny)
