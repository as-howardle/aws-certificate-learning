VPC endpoint is a powerful feature of AWS that allows you to establish a private connection between your VPC and other supported
AWS services and VPC endpoint service. The VPC endpoints use the PrivateLink feature to make the pirvate connection possible between your
VPC and AWS services. Using VPC endpoint, the traffice between your VPC and AWS services does not leave the Amazon network. In other word,
VPC endopoints serve as a private connection between your VPC, AWS services, and even your on-premise applications. Using PrivateLinkfor connectivity
means the traffice is not only secure, but latency because of the public internet is also reduced.

Using VPC endpoints can be handly in situations like the following:
- If you want to connect your VPC to another AWS VPC but do not have VPN or TWG access
- The other VPC has an overlapping IP address with your VPC
- You want to share your VPC with external customers but do not want traffic to leave the AWS network

**** VPC interface endpoint ****
An interface endpoint is an elastic network interface (ENI) similar to a virtual network card but with a private IP address. The private IP
will be from the IP address range of the subnet already specified by the user. The ENI will act as the main entry point for the traffice going
to any supported AWS service.

Using an interface endpoint, you can connect your private IP address to different AWS services like an elastic load blancer, cloudformation, SNS,...
Interface endpoint alse allow you to connect to supported marketplace partner services which are hosted by AWS partners or customers in their own VPCs.
Your security group managers the traffic from the VPC resources to the endpoint ENI. PrivateLink then ensures that the VPC traffice to other AWS services does
not go to the public internet.

The VPC interface endpoint is not free. You will be charged based on the usage and data processing rates for privatelink.
Charges for creating and using interface endpoints are on top of that.

**** VPC gateway endpoint ****
Consider a scenario where you have to access S3 from your EC2 instance in a public subnet. As the subnet has an internet gateway attched,
the traffice to S3 will go through the public internet. However, the problem aries if your instance is in a private subnet and does not have any NAT gatway/instance
attched or you cannot afford charges of NAT gateway. Currently, AWS S3 and DynamoDB are the only services supported by gateway endpoints. Using Gateway endopoints
does not incur any data processing or hourly charges.
