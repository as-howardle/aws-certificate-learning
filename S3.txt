**** Introduce to S3 ****
S3 Object: objects contain your data. They are like files. It may consist of:
		Key: is the name of the object
		Value: data of the file
		Version ID: when versioning enabled, the version of object
		Metadata: additional information attached to the object

S3 Bucket: hold objects. Bucket can also have folders which in turn hold objects. S3 is a universal name so bucket names must be unique (think like having a domain name)

**** S3 Storage classes ****
- Standard (default): Fast! 99.99% Availability, 11 9's Durability. Replicated across at least three AZs
- Standard Infrequently Accessed (IA): Still fast! Cheaper if you access files less than once a month. Additional retrieval fee is applied. 50% less than Standard (reduced availability)
- One to One IA: Still fast! Objects only exist in one AZ. Availability (is 99.5%). But cheaper than Standard IA by 20% less (reduce durability). Data could get destroyed. A retrieval fee is applied.
- Glacier: For long-term cold storage. Retrieval of data can take minutes to hours but the off is very cheap storage.
