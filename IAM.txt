- Identity Access Management is used to manage access to users and resources
- IAM is a universal system (applied to all regions at the same time and is a free service)
- A root account is the account initialy created when AWS is set up (full administrator)
- New IAM accounts have no permissions by default until granted
- New users get assigned an Access Key Id and Secret when first created when you give them programmatic access
- Access Keys are only used for CLI and SDK (cannot access console)
- Access Keys are only shown oce when created. If lost they must be deleted and recreated again
- Always setup MFA for Root accounts
- Users must enable MFA on their own, Administrator cannot turn it on for each user
- IAM allows you set password policies to set minimum password requirements or rotate passwords
- IAM identities as Users, Groups, and Roles
- IAM Users: end users who log into the console or interact with AWS resources programmatically
- IAM Groups: group up your users so they can all share permission levels of the group
- IAM Roles: Associate permissions to a Role and then assign this to an Users and Groups
- IAM Policies: JSON documents which grant permissions for specific user, group or role to access
services. Policies are attached to IAM identities
- Managed Policies are policies provided by AWS and cannot be edited
- Customer Managed Policies are policies created by customer, which you can edit
- Inline Policies are policies which are direct
