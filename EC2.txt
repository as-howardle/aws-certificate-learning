- EC2 is a cloud computing service
- Configure your EC2 by choosing your OS, Storage, Memory, Network Throughput
- Lauch and SSH into your server within minute
- EC2 comes in variety Instance Types specialized for different roles:
 + General Purpose: balance of compute, memory and networking resources
 + Compute Optimized: ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance processor
 + Memory Optimized: fast perfomance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
 + Accelerated Optimized: hardware accelerators, or co-processors
 + Storage Optimized: high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage
- Instance Sizes generally doouble in price and key attributes
- Placement Groups: let you choose the logical placement of your instance to optimize for communication, performance or durability. Placement groups are free
- UserData: a script that will be automatically run when launching an EC2 instance
- MetaData: meta data about the current instance. You can access this meta data via local endpoint when SSH into the EC2 instance. Eg: curl http://169.254.169.254/lastest/meta-data
- Instance Profiles: a container for an IAM role that you can use to pass role information to an EC2 instance when the instance starts
